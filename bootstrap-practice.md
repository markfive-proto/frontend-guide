# Practice
## Using Bootstrap Framework & basics you should know
Students are required to finish task 1 - 4 & show me the working files on 6th October 2017.
*Please use bootstrap version 3.3 for this practice!*
http://getbootstrap.com/

## 1. Include bootstrap in your project/index.html file.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/
To start include these in the head tag of your html file & we are ready to go:
```
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">

test

<!-- Optional theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" integrity="sha384-rHyoN1iRsVXV4nD0JutlnGaslCJuC7uwjduW9SVrLvRYooPp2bWYgmgJQIXwl/Sp" crossorigin="anonymous">

<!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
### Observe what is the difference when the above code is in your project.

## 2. Include classes that you can use.
Bootstrap comes with a list of classes & IDs that you can use in your project.
Check the CSS page here & try using some of the class in your index.html page.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/

## 3. Include Grid System
Understand the basics of what is a 12 grid column system in bootstrap, how does that affect the layout that you are going to build?

## 4. Include Menu Navigation Bar
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar

## 5. Overiding CSS class
*This is a task that requires some thinking of what you have learned so far.
Create a new resources to your index.html file via the dreamweaver right panel.
Have a class name that is exactly the same with 1 of the class used in bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/
So how do we have our own attributes overwrite the existing attributes that has been defined in the bootstrap framework?
eg. 
Try changing this button to a different color in your css file:
```
<!-- Standard button -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default">Default</button>
```
